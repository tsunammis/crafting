"""
A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes.
In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the linked list.
A doubly linked list gives each node pointers to both the next node and the
previous node.

Unlike an array, a linked list doest not provide constant time access to a
particular "index" within the list.
This means that if you would like to find the Kth element in the list, you will
need to iterate through K elements.

The benefit of a linked list is that you can add an remove items from the
beginning of the list in constant time. For specific applications, this can be
useful.
